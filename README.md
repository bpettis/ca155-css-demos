# CA 155 - Advanced CSS Demos

These are copies of the files used during my guest lecture for CA 155: 
Intro to Digital Media Production. In it, I demonstrate some recent CSS 
techniques and functions to build responsive websites. These include:

- absolute vs relative CSS units
- flexbox and grid
- clamp() and minmax()
- CSS variables

You can find the files for each demonstration in their own directories. 
There are also word documents within the "tutorials" directory with more 
expansive notes and documentation for each example.
