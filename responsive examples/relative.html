    <h1>This Ram is an ABSOLUTE UNIT</h1>

    <p>According to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-unit">Know Your Meme</a>, Absolute Unit refers to jokes made on Twitter in which people caption images of large objects or people with a variation on the phrase, "In awe at the size of this lad. Absolute unit."</p>
    <p>As much as we may like admiring photos of absolute units, when designing with HTML and CSS, if we actually <em>avoid</em> absolute units and use relative units instead, our websites will be much more responsive</p>
